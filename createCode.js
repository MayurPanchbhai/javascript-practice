// sunstring():method fetch the string on the basis of provided index and returns the new sub string. It works similar to the slice() method with a difference that it doesn't accepts negative indexes. This method doesn't make any change in the original string.

// String.substring(start,end);

let srt ="As long as power flows through any of my circuits, Megatron, I'll fight you.";

let srt2=srt.substring(2,49);

console.log(srt2);
